    label: An age verification credential
    comment: >
      A Verifiable Credential that contains an individual's age category,
      typically issued by an age verification system (such as TruAge).
      The AgeVerificationCredential is bound to the Personal Photo
      Verifiable Credential in a privacy-preserving manner
      (via a cryptographic hash). This Verifiable Credential contains a
      `refreshService` API endpoint and is used by software to
      request additional `OverAgeTokenCredential`s, when they are consumed.

      The age verification container credential cryptographically binds an
      `AgeVerificationCredential` to one or more `OverAgeTokenCredential`s.

  - id: OverAgeTokenCredential
    label: Privacy-preserving single-use tokenized age credential
    comment: >
      A privacy-preserving single-use tokenized age credential that can be
      used during an age-gated transaction. The receiver of this credential
      can verify both the age category of the holder that delivered this
      credential and know that the credential has been digitally signed by an
      age verification authority without being able to track the individual
      using the token. The age verification authority is the only entity that
      can map the single-use token back to an individual. This process is
      manual, and only occurs if a legal subpoena for information is filed
      in a court of law during a legal proceeding. An individual that uses
      these tokens will utilize a different token per transaction, which
      protects their privacy among anyone engaging in an age-gated transaction
      with the individual while meeting regulatory burden for age-gated
      transactions that require that a proof of age was checked. This
      credential is either presented electronically over the Internet, or
      displayed as a single-use QR Code at a point of sale.

    range: xsd:positiveInteger
    comment: >
      This property is not intended to establish the exact age of the subject.
      Many overAge use cases require that the subject is viewed by an
      individual, given some discrection, to be a certain age based on the local
      laws. For example, imagine an individual is celebrating their birthday on
      which they become eligible to purchase and consume alcohol. If they were
      born at 11pm on their birthday, but the dinner is occuring at a restaurant
      at 6pm, a waiter is highly likely to determine them to be of age and allow
      them to purchase alcohol. It is with this imprecision noted that this
      property should be used. Effectively, the subject will be at least this
      age, give or take a day.
