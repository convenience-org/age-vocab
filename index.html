      <p>
This vocabulary is used to express privacy-protecting assertions of age.
      </p>
      <p class="issue">
This entire document is a work in progress and should be considered in beta
until it is ratified as an official document via the World Wide Web Consortium.

        typeof="rdf:Property">
        <h3>overAge</h3>
        <p>
Specifies that the subject is at least equal to or above the provided age.
        </p>
        <p>
This property is not intended to establish the exact age of the subject. Many
`overAge` use cases require that the subject is viewed by an individual, given
some discrection, to be a certain age based on the local laws. For example,
imagine an individual is celebrating their birthday on which they become
eligible to purchase and consume alcohol. If they were born at 11pm on their
birthday, but the dinner is occuring at a restaurant at 6pm, a waiter is highly
likely to determine them to be of age and allow them to purchase alcohol. It
is with this imprecision noted that this property should be used. Effectively,
the subject will be at least this age, give or take a day.
