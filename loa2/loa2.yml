    comment: >
      This Verifiable Credential communicates information about a document check
      that would be necessary for a system to validate whether or not to accept
      it as a valid identity proofing event. This information includes:
      <ul><li>The Document Number of the individual's identity document (e.g. driver's license #)</li><li>The Issuing Authority (e.g. a specific DMV)</li><li>The individual's Date of Birth</li><li>The Expiration Date of the identity document</li><li>A cryptographic hash of a credential containing the individual's photo</li></ul>
      This mechanism is designed to be used with systems that only collect the
      minimum amount of information required to perform age verification during
      a transaction. This mechanism is designed to preserve the individual's
      privacy and therefore does not collect biometric images or non-relevant
      data from the identity document (but rather cryptographically links to the
      biometric information in case the check needs to be performed in the
      future against the same image used during the check).
      The NIST Identity Assurance Level 2 Age Assurance Verifiable Credential
      must be from an issuer which is a trusted Issuing Authority (e.g. a
      particular DMV) represented by a known Decentralized Identifier (DID).

      A personal photo credential references a credential containing an image
      that has been used during an identity proofing process. The object itself
      is privacy-preserving and only contains an identifier and a cryptographic
      hash of the credential containing the image. The image associated with
      the personal photo credential matches against the image associated
      with the `identityDocument` and the individual that presented both
      pieces of information during an interactive identity proofing event
      that was performed either in person or remotely.

      - label: A personal photo credential

      An identity document that was used during an identity proofing process.
      The object itself is minimizes the identity document fields shared to the
      minimum necessary for the transaction. The image associated with the
      identity document is assumed to be matched against the
      `personalPhotoCredential` as the during an interactive identity proofing
      event that was performed either in person or remotely.
